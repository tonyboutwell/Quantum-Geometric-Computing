# Quantum Geometric Computing
QGC converts problems from the quantum formalism into a native geometric language where they can be solved directly and efficiently. The UCE and UGAF described in our paper provide a complete, polynomial-time engine for this conversion. The G-VM provides an intelligent, adaptive runtime that guarantees both speed and accuracy.
